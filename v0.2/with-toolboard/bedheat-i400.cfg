[heater_bed]
heater_pin: H0
#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
sensor_type: Generic 3950
#   Type of sensor - common thermistors are "EPCOS 100K B57560G104F",
#   "ATC Semitec 104GT-2", "ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G", "Generic
#   3950","Honeywell 100K 135-104LAG-J01", "NTC 100K MGB18-104F39050L32",
#   "SliceEngineering 450", and "TDK NTCG104LH104JT1". See the
#   "Temperature sensors" section for other sensors. This parameter
#   must be provided.
sensor_pin: T1
#   Analog input pin connected to the sensor. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#control: pid
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
pwm_cycle_time: 0.016667

pid_kp: 37.226
#⚠TO BE CALIBRATED⚠
#   Kp is the "proportional" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.
pid_ki: 1.504
#⚠TO BE CALIBRATED⚠
#   Ki is the "integral" constant for the pid. This parameter must be
#   provided for PID heaters.
pid_kd: 230.338
#⚠TO BE CALIBRATED⚠
#   Kd is the "derivative" constant for the pid. This parameter must
#   be provided for PID heaters.

min_temp: -100
max_temp: 125
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error.
#   These parameters must be provided.
max_power: 0.70
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.
smooth_time: 3.0
#   A time value (in seconds) over which temperature measurements will
#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 1 seconds.
